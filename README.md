# internship-task

This repository contains a homework task for an internship position. It should help us assess the level of your python skills, analytical thinking and mathematical background.
The data provided are an edited version of MIMIC-III data example. 

1. Create a jupyter notebook
2. Load the data from the .csv file
3. Perform a data analysis of the dataset - focus on using the python libraries such as: os, pandas, numpy, plotly/matplotlib
4. Store any helper functions you use withing notebook as a utils.py script/module and then import it to the notebook.
5. Prepare a short text description how would you further process the data if you knew, it will be a base dataset for anomaly detection on heart rate data.

Be creative :) but do not spend too much time on it, couple of hours should be sufficient for sure.

Further data processing ideas:
- Focus on better defining what is the definition of anomalie (work with the outliers )
- Finding a pattern for hearth rate anomalies in subset_df dataframe 
- Prepare a function to assign Heart_rhythm to a specyfic Heart_rate's types over time
- Resample the data to a fixed time interval (I did not check it)
- Handle missing and 0 hearth rate values, maybe there is also some kind of information in this values?
